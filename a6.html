<p>Shiba Inu token (ticker: SHIB) is a decentralized cryptocurrency created in August 2020 by an anonymous person or group known as "Ryoshi".It is named after the Shiba Inu (柴犬), a Japanese breed of dog originating in the Chūbu region, the same breed that is depicted in Dogecoin's symbol, itself originally a satirical cryptocurrency based on the Doge meme.Shiba Inu has been characterized as a "meme coin" and a pump and dump scheme.There have also been concerns about the concentration of the coin with a single "whale" wallet controlling billions of dollars' worth of the token, and frenzied buying by retail investors motivated by fear of missing out (FOMO).

<p>Shiba Inu was created in August 2020, dubbing itself the 'Dogecoin killer'.On 13 May, Vitalik Buterin donated more than 50 trillion SHIB (worth over $1 billion at the time) to the India COVID-Crypto Relief Fund.

The exchange price of the cryptocurrency notably surged in early October 2021. Its value increased 240% over the week.However, at the beginning of November the price dropped and continued to fall, ending the month having lost approximately 55% of its value.</p>
<p>Despite its satirical nature, some consider it a legitimate investment prospect. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the "Doge" meme as its logo and namesake.It was introduced on December 6, 2013, and quickly developed its own online community, reaching a market capitalization of over $85 billion[a] on May 5, 2021.It is the current shirt sponsor (sleeve only) of Premier League club Watford.Dogecoin.com promotes the currency as the "fun and friendly Internet currency", referencing its origins as a "joke."[9] Software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer launched the satirical cryptocurrency as a way to make fun of bitcoin and the many other cryptocurrencies boasting grand plans to take over the world. With the help of Reddit, the site became an instant hit. Within two weeks, Dogecoin had established a dedicated blog and forum, and its market value has reached $8 million, once jumping to become the seventh largest electronic currency in the world.[10] Dogecoin is based on Scrypt algorithm, and the transaction process is more convenient than Bitcoin. Dogecoin takes only 1 minute to confirm, while BTC takes 10 minutes.[citation </p>
